### if your content has a beginning middle and end, use pagination

Continuing from *#23*, *Use “Infinite Scroll” For Feed–Style Content Only*, a pag-

inated, multi-page list may seem “old school” but it has a few major benefits:

- It’s goal-oriented, so the user is trying to find the item they need in a list and pagination feels intuitive, instead of having to search through an endless list
- It remembers the user’s position and displays the current page to them
- It conveys a beginning, middle, and end to the content
- Users can use the scroll bar to navigate the page and they can reach the footer if they need to

Show the user the current page, some pages before and after it, and the lowest and highest pages in the range. Adding “next” and “previous” buttons can be a useful aid for mobile users who may find the page numbers too fiddly to tap.

Given all of this, users won’t find it easy to search through very long lists: it’s just too cognitively arduous. **A search, sort, or filter control should be considered mandatory on lists of more than a few pages**.

- Use pagination when the content is finite
- Show the user the current page, nearby pages, and the highest and lowest pages in the range
- Offer the user search, sort, and filter controls
