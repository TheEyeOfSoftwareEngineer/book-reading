### Make the whole button clickable not just the text

- Your button should look and behave like a button—clicking anywhere on the button should activate it.

- Make the pointer turn into a hand when you hover over the button on desktop.

- Give the user some visual feedback that the button has been clicked—on mobile this could be audio or vibration, but avoid this for desktop.
