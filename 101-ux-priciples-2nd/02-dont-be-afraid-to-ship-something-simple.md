### Don't be afraid to ship something simple

You don’t wait for a “big bang” release; you don’t perfect every aspect of your product—you release *valuable* software out to users as soon as it’s ready, and you update it continuously.

Trust me—your users don’t care about these reasons. Your product doesn’t need to be a *whole new category* of product; it just needs to help users *get their shit* *done*. Fewer, better features are better for the user experience than trying to cram too much in, pushing deadlines and developers until your user ends up with 100 half-baked features instead of 25 excellent ones—and a later release date.

Create a well-researched, well-defined scope for your first version, so that— when stakeholders inevitably get *the fear* about missing features compared to competitors—there is justification and strategy for continuing with the minimal version release and then iterating later based on what you learned.
