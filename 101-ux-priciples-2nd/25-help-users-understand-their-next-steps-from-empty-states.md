### help users understand their next steps from empty states

An empty state is a view that would normally show a lot of information to a user—a list of projects, albums, tasks, and so on—but because the user is new, they haven’t yet created anything.

An empty state is a view that would normally show a lot of information to a user—a list of projects, albums, tasks, and so on—but because the user is new, they haven’t yet created anything.

An empty state should usually show some helpful text, hints, and maybe a friendly graphic or icon. Now, because these views can appear on a per-feature basis, it’s easy to be very task-oriented in the advice you give. If the user views the to-do list, you can advise on making the first to-do item.

What’s more, offering clear calls to action (CTAs) in these empty states can be the difference between a user never engaging with your product, or a successful onboarding experience, and should be considered vital.

- Use empty states to orient new users

- Be task-oriented in the advice you give to users

- Be specific in your advice if you offer empty states on a per-feature basis
