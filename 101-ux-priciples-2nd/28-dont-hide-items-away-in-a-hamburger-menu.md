### Don't hide items away in a hamburger menu

Research shows that hamburger menus:

- Slow down discovery time for users
- Increase perceived task difficulty
- Increase the time it takes to complete a task

Simply put, the hamburger menu hides items away from users and makes them less discoverable. Additionally, because the menu is hidden, users can’t gain a sense of “where they are” in the product.

Some alternative design patterns to the hamburger menu:

- **Navigation on the bottom of the view**: Made popular by iOS apps, you can get four or five key features into an ever-present bottom menu and maybe make the fifth item “fly out” containing advanced tools.
- **Tabbed navigation**: Inverting the above, and popularized by Android apps, items can live at the top of the view.

- **Breadcrumbs**: The good old tried-and-tested breadcrumb navigation (see *#77*, *Use Breadcrumb Navigation*) is a simple list of underlined links. It is well understood by users and combines easy navigation with showing the current page.

If you **must** use a hamburger menu, then label it **Menu** and spare the user the much-maligned and ambiguous “three lines” icon.
