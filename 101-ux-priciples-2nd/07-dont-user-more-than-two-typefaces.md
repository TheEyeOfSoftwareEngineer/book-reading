### Don't use more than two typefaces

It’s a pretty common point of confusion, but typefaces and fonts are different things. “Proper” design professionals call them “typefaces,” while fonts are the files on the device that the software *uses* to display the typeface. Fonts are the paint on the palette, while the typeface is the masterpiece on the canvas.

For example, Helvetica is one of the most widely used typefaces, but a font is a particular set of glyphs within that font family: for example, Helvetica Con- densed Bold, 10pt.

Regardless, too often designers add too many typefaces to their products. You should aim to use two typefaces maximum: one for headings and titles, and another for body copy that is intended to be read in depth.

Using too many typefaces creates too much visual “noise” and increases the effort that the user has to put into understanding the view in front of them. What’s more, many custom-designed brand typefaces are often made with a punchy visual impact in mind, not readability.
