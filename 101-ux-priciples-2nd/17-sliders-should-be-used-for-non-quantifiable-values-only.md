### sliders should be used for non quatifiable values only

- slider controls should never be used for setting specific numeric values
- use sliders for adjusting qualitative settings sucn as volume and brightness, where a precise value isn't needed
- make the slider control a sensible size that can be easily grabbed by the user's pointing device
