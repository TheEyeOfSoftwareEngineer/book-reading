### Allow users to undo destructive actions

The best apps allow users to back out of such actions, either with undo controls or by giving users the ability to edit actions before they’re final. Google’s Gmail has had an optional “undo send” feature for quite some time. This stores your sent message in a “buffer” for 20 seconds, giving you that short grace period to cancel sending. If you just ignore it, you know the message will be sent shortly. This particular feature has saved me many times.

- Allow users to undo their mistakes
- give users a greater sense of freedom and control
- be forgiving; people will make mistakes
