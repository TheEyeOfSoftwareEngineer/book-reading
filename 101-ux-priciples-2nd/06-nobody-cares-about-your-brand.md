### Nobody cares about your brand

What about your brand, with a few thousand or tens of thousands of customers, or your small company, product, or newly launched start-up? *Nobody cares*. Harsh, but true. None of your users care about your brand. They care about what your product or service *lets them do*.They care about how your product improves their lives and enhances their productivity, and so on.

Donâ€™t let the brand guide ruin your product with:

- Unreadable brand typeface
- Branded splash screens
- Build-your-own nightmarish UI controls
- Awful, unreadable contrast ratios
- Unnecessarily quirky copy
