### Don't use a drop down menu if you only have a few options

A drop-down menu in the user interface is designed to expand when clicked and present a range of options. This is fine for customization, where there *genuinely are* plenty of options.

There is, however, an overhead to operating a drop-down menu: the user needs to click to open, scroll to the correct item, and then click to select. On a mobile device, this can be even slower, as the user will be using a smaller screen.

Sort your options into a sensible order—alphabetical or numerical—rather than random. Don’t be the app that asks users to select a floor of a building in alphabetical order: “First, Fourth, Ground, Second, Third.” Yes, I’ve seen this in the wild!

- Drop-down menus can be a pain, so only use them if you need to

- Offer the ability to search in very long drop-downs
- Drop-downs can be useful in mobile apps, as the user will have a spe- cialized UI to use
