### make your links look like links

The style-on-hover approach is less than ideal: users on touchscreen devices have no hover state. Meanwhile, users with a mouse end up “hunting” for links by hovering over parts of text bit by bit, hoping to find a link, or just never finding them at all.

When adding visual affordances to links, don’t forget to include the state of the link (active, followed, and so on), and ensure that disabled links (and other controls) are sufficiently different from your link styling.

One of the earliest conventions of the web: styling visited links a different color, is still vital—it helps users work out where they’ve already been and avoids frustrating wasted clicks.

Asking the user to click things just to work out what they do (or whether they do anything at all) is insane. This kind of design decision is a classic example of form over function. If you’re making your users guess what links do, because you think that “minimalism” means adding so few affordances that controls are impossible to use, then you’re wrong. I don’t care what the marketing guys say: make your links underlined.

- Make links look like links with visual affordances

- Don’t make non-links look like links

- Don’t make your users hunt for clickable controls
