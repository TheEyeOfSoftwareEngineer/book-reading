### Don't invent new, arbitrary controls

As designers, we already have a rich palette of existing controls to choose from. If you’re thinking about making a new UI control, please stop and think about how hard it will be for users to learn yet another interface pattern. I promise you this—there’s already a way to do what you want to do.

However, every now and then, something new comes along that is genuinely an advance in UI. Back in 2008, Loren Brichter made a Twitter app called **Tweetie**, with a unique pull-to-refresh interaction. Pulling the view down would show “release to refresh” and releasing would show a spinner. The pull-to-refresh in- teraction went on to be included in Twitter, which bought Tweetie, and then in iOS and Android apps in their hundreds.

“Swipe right” in dating apps to choose a potential partner and “double-tap to like” in Instagram get honorable mentions as some more recent, novel interac- tion patterns. As you can see, inventing something new that works and doesn’t confuse users is the exception rather than the rule.
