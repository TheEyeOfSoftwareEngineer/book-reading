### Use A/B testing to test your ideas

A/B testing is a technique that involves splitting a user base into two groups or populations and showing two different designs (“A” and “B”) to each group to see which design performs better. A/B testing gives the best results with larger populations of users; over 1,000 is a good sensible minimum to give meaningful results.

It’s that simple: set up two different versions of your UI and use some software (many free and paid services are available) to serve them equally to visitors.Tag each group with a label in your analytics software and you can see easily which design performed better against your chosen conversion metric: whether that’s checkout conversions, sign-ups, or something else.

- Use A/B testing to work out which design performs better
- Make sure “performs better” means the design performs better for the user

- A/B testing works well with two distinctly different designs, rather than just tiny changes
