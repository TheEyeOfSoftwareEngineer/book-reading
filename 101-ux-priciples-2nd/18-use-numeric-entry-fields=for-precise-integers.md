### Use numeric entry fields for precise integers

If you’re trying to get an integer (a whole number) from a user—for example the number of widgets they want to order or the number of days an event runs for—it makes no sense to offer them a free text input field where they can enter “a few” or an emoji.

- numeric input controls should be used for setting specific numeric values
- Forms always require more effort from users than just consuming content, so minimize the number of “things” you ask them for
