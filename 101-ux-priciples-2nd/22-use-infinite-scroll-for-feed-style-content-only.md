### Use infinite scroll for feed style content only

Infinite scroll—where the page just keeps scrolling, loading more items asyn- chronously as the user hits the bottom—is extremely handy for users.

However, infinite scroll should be limited to only a few types of content. If applied to finite lists (messages, emails, to-do items, and so on), then the user has no way of determining a beginning, middle, and end to the content. When used with this kind of content, infinite scroll is confusing and slower to use, so save it for feeds.

- use pagination for long lists of items
- use infinite scroll for newsfeed-style content only
- remember the user's position if they navigate away from the feed
