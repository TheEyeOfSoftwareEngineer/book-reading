### Search should be a text field with a button labeled search

**Instant search**, where typing instantly shows results to the user, is often better than showing a separate search results page. Instant results are obviously more immediate and can let the user navigate to a result without breaking their flow inside your product.

On a mobile phone screen, there may not be enough space to always show the search field, but Iâ€™d still encourage you to evaluate whether you can fit one in. Tucking the search field into the top of a scrolling view can work well.

- Search should be a text field with a search button
- only use the magnifiying glass icon for search
- move the focus to the search field when the search tab is tapped on mobile
