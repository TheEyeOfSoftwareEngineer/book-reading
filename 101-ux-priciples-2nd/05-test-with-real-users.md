### Test with real users

User testing is an essential step to understanding not just your product, but the users you’re testing—what their goals really are, how they want to achieve them, and where your product delivers or falls short. You’ll not only understand your users better, but you’ll reduce development time by short-circuiting the feedback loop and getting problems fixed much earlier in the product life cycle.

So, what are you testing? User tests are, in themselves, a broad spectrum of activ- ities ranging from “guerilla-style” tests—where you approach a random person and ask them to perform a task in the app—through to specific feature-based tests, where an expert user (usually with domain knowledge) is asked to perform a complex task. Either way, you need to start with an idea of what you’re testing, tuned to both the complexity level of the product and the domain knowledge that a user needs to operate it.

A few of the most common usability testing methods are:

- Guerilla testing: informal and ad hoc, as mentioned above. This method is cheap, rapid, and great for getting an early steer on your proposed solutions.
- Lab tests: performed in controlled conditions with a moderator. This method provides greater insight into the users’ motivations, but they can be costly and slow to yield results.
- Remote testing: performed unmoderated, where the user is left to their own devices. This method does not provide the same depth of feedback, but you can scale these tests up to thousands of participants.

Too often, products aren’t tested, the thinking being that “we’ll just hear what users don’t like and fix it.” The problem is that *your users won’t tell you*; they’ll just leave. The near-infinite choice of products and services on the web, app stores, and a myriad of devices means that the user has no incentive to stay, complain, and help you to improve your product—it will simply fail.

The cost of switching to an alternative for a user is almost zero—a quick Google for a competitor and they’re gone for good. Test with real users and listen to them, and you’ll build something they love.
