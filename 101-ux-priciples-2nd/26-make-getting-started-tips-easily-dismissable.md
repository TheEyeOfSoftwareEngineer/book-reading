###  make getting started tips easily dismissable

An extra level of rage is induced when an app update “resets” these tips and existing users are forced to sit through the tutorial all over again just to use the app. To avoid this, tell users what will be covered in the tutorial and make tips optional and dismissible. You’ll get bonus points for letting users exit the entire “onboarding wizard”with one tap—at any point in the journey or at the very start:

However, beware of overdoing these tips: if you’ve followed conventions (and basically, the rest of this book), there shouldn’t be a need to explain every little detail of your app’s UI.
