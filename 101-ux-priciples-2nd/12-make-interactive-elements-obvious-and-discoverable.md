### Make interactive elements obvious and discoverable

Buttons in real life look pushable: they’re raised or they suggest an obvious way that they might move if pushed. For example, they might have an indicator light and look more prominent when enabled. You should copy these features into your UI.

The inverse is also true: there are real-world buttons that *don’t* look pushable— flat capacitive buttons on car park machines and coffee machines spring to mind—and these buttons are often accompanied by a stuck-on, handwritten *press here for ticket* note.

Create the visual cues your user needs to know instantly that they’re looking at a button that can be tapped or clicked.

- Make buttons look like buttons.
- Make anything that can be interacted with look interactable.
- Borrow ideas from real-world experiences in your UI.
